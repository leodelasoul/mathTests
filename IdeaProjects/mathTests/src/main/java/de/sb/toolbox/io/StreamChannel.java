/**
 * Instances of this class provide combined read&write access to an underlying seekable resource,
 * usually a file. They provide two stream views for read and write access, which both operate on
 * the same position pointer. Therefore, reading a couple of bytes has the effect the the current
 * write pointer also moves forward, and vice versa. This implies that the input stream view is used
 * for both reading data, and repositioning the underlying channel, while the output stream view is
 * used solely for writing.<br />
 * Note the main advantage of this class over directly accessing a seekable byte channel is the
 * avoidance of having to deal with the {@link ByteBuffer} API. Being forced to deal with the
 * latter in every read and write operation is probably the main reason why the whole channel API is
 * less widely known and used than it deserves, likely because the ByteBuffer-API is more suited for
 * data conversion, assemblage, and buffering than streaming I/O.
